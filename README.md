This projetc is developped using .NET CORE 3.1 . The idea is that a user will sign up inorder to use the system once he is signed up he can login again later.

The user cant enter the website unless he is registered applying authentication.

When a user is registered he can search for wanted trips from destination and arrival .

After choosing the suitable trip the website will load the trip with price . 

A user can reserve multiple trips . user will pay for all selected trip using stripe paymet gateway by clicking the button for paymnet.

A one user can't see trips of other users neither paying for their trips.
